Solar Energy Forecasting and Dashboard Monitoring Using Machine Learning
Welcome to this applied machine learning project focused on solar energy forecasting using real-world environmental data. This project explores and compares several powerful regression models for predicting daily solar radiation and is tailored for global applicability,especially beneficial for energy professionals, researchers, and clean energy enthusiasts.
Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a reliable machine learning pipeline that can accurately predict daily solar radiation (kWh/mÂ²) based on multiple meteorological parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, solar angles, wind speed, etc.). Accurate solar forecasting is crucial for:

Designing and scaling solar PV systems

Power demand management

Energy policy planning

Integrating renewables into smart grids
